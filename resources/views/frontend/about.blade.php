          Hostel paddy is a start-up created by a team of like-minded
          individuals that have experienced the pain and struggle of getting
          accommodation. We have crafted a solution but targeted at students
          in tertiary institutions across the country.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="lead">
          We offer students a solution to get rid of inaccessibility, hassle
          and bureaucracies, with a platform that is easy, fast and safe, for
          total peace of mind, offering unique places for every budget, just
          for a month or forever, just a click away.

        <p class="lead">
          Built to solve hostel accommodation deficit and complications for
          students in Nigerian tertiary institutions, we bring a marketplace
          for students and house owners to be accessible to each other. With
          over one hundred and fifty private and public tertiary institutions
          in the country and a sizable carrying capacity of over six hundred
          thousand students, it is obvious that a solution is needed.
